# Move It
This Emacs package provides functionality for conveniently moving around text,
akin to the [move-text](https://github.com/emacsfodder/move-text) and
[drag-stuff](https://github.com/rejeep/drag-stuff.el) packages.[^1] Mostly
implemented just for fun, and does not necessarily provide much novelty compared
to the above-mentioned packages (besides perhaps some customization concerning
the default behavior).

[^1]: Obviously, this package is heavily inspired by `move-text` and `drag-stuff`
as well.
